    <p>In 1977, the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 didn‚Äôt just launch ‚Äî they exploded onto the scene, kicking off a digital revolution.These weren‚Äôt just machines; they were time machines to the future.
      <ul>
        <li>Apple II: Came with color graphics (a big deal back then) and the ability to run games that made kids skip homework.</li>
        <li>Commodore PET: Sleek, all-in-one design with a built-in monitor ‚Äî the ‚Äúcool kid‚Äù of early computing.</li>
        <li>TRS-80: Affordable and practical, often found in classrooms, making it the ‚Äúteacher‚Äôs pet‚Äù of PCs.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     üí° Fun fact: At the time, many people didn‚Äôt believe computers belonged in homes. Within a few years, they became the new household appliance ‚Äî right next to the TV and toaster.
